# Start project gingko
# Gingko is a point to point rsync rolling checksum proto-
# col implemented file synchronize application. Instead
# of original rsync builds, we want to make it able to 
# sync files from a large mesh computer network so-called 
# the cloud and pushing files from computers to computers,
# the P2P protocol will make it more efficient.
# Hope it success!

NOTE：
    For reusing some code between clnt and serv, I write some funcs in gingko_common.h
with some MACRO, I know this is ugly, but the bins compiled out work well...so, let it
be.

DEPS:
    libevent
    gtest (when ./configure --enable-unittest)
